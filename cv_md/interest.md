# Research Mission

To identify and exploit structure-property relationships to design and optimize functional materials for, including but not limited to, electronic and optoelectronic applications. 
I explore the fundamental nature of materials including imperfections and their interaction with light. 
I aim to tackle technical challenges and to establish reliable theory to be able to calculate all properties of any materials via multiscale materials theory such as First-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling.
